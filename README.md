# Logistic-Regression-Model
Built a logistic regression model which has two independent features and a target feature.
Created dummies/converted the categorical features into binary form using map method
Trained the model with Binary Predictors dataset
Tested the model with Test dataset
Clustering algorithms are not done 
Training accuracy was 94.6%
Testing accuracy was 89.4%
There is a lot of room for improvement for this model since tuning and clustering algorithms are not used.
